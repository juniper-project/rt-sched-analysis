The Real-time Scheduling Analyser implements Response-Time Analysis
of applications modelled by Directed Acyclic Graphs.
Nodes in a graph represent computations (e.g., CPU, I/O), while edges
represent precedence constraints among these computations.                                 
It can be used both as a stand-alone command line tool or integrated
within the JUNIPER MDE Enrivonment.

Prerequisites: it requires the development support for libxml2. In
Debian distribution the required package is libxml2-dev.
